		// Chessmove that still needs a test
		* Opponent played en-passentable move, player can play en passent but it is not the win, or it is an alternative win




		// Need to check if its check mate and also count that as a win


		// Clean Up Chess code


		// Fix en passent

		* Make sure a loaded level is stored so player faces it next login

		* Issue with promotions as solution
			* Make player unable to move pieces when picking a promotion
			* Implement Computer promotions

		* Issue with castles? - Prob just a regular move, but needs implementation in my code correctly
		* Issue with en passent as solutions?



		* Make sure invalid chess moves are ignored
			* Moving to unreachable tile
			* Placing on a piece of same color
		

		* Add reset button for Upgrades on cheatbar
		* Add complete tiers amount and multiplier?


		* RESEARCH
		* Move to first unbought when completing a tier

		
		* Make sure description text for rewards show correctly with different text fonts
				
        // Maybe not have gems GPS added when away??


		// Issue, gains are added as their values when added, but multipliers the player buy afterwards does not act on these earlier gains. Need to recalculate the entire gain every time gain changes?

		* Show welcome box with away income when loading a game

		* EveryTime a save is made also update the DateTime


		* Have issue with adding multipliers for income and gain, need to store them in a list SO etc
		

		// SAVING
			* Building levels
				every time a building is built update the buildings levels in player game data
			* Upgrades purchased
				every time an upgrade is bought update the upgrades owned dictionary in player game data
			* Held coins, gems
				contantly update this to the player game data so it is up to date when a save is happening?
			* GPS coins, gems
				This is derived from the upgrades only so dont need to save?
				Only need the base income? Base income is also constant so no

		- AutoSave at regular interval?


		// Make sure adding buildings or upgrades does not break old save files



		* Increment: Cost = BaseCost*multiplier^n
		* n = cost for building number n

		* Bulk buy =>  TotalCost = BaseCost * Multiplier^n*(multiplier^k-1)/(Multiplier -1)




		3. Typical Multipliers

		Slow growth (idle-heavy games): 1.05–1.10 (+5–10% per buy)

		Medium growth (balanced): 1.12–1.15

		Fast growth (prestige resets often): 1.2–1.5



		* Have numbers fixed in size so they dont move around when changing values.
		

		// Decide how to refill health - timer or potions?
		// Implement ORBs upgrades after deaths

		JAM 9/6 - 15/6 22:00

		* Add timer for enemy movement in relation to player movement ???

		// MUST HAVE
		* Implement several stages
		* Game Name
		* Itch page
		* Main Menu 
		* Currency gold and orbs
		* Character Animations

		// LIKE TO HAVE
		* Bosses?
		* Random generated levels?
		* Biomes?
		* Implement shop between levels - every or every 5th etc??
		* Fix color Palette for Characters
		* Damage dealt effects
		* Random Generated dungeons
		* Maybe issue - can have no sword equipped but still attacks with melee
		* Allow rotations? Make smooth transitions	

		// PROB NOT
