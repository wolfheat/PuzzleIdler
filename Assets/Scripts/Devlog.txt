DEVLOG FOR Idle Game with a puzzle touch

Aug 2025

* IDEAS
- Make an idle game that has some puzzle or other game mechanics in it.

10/8	* Project started
		* Made basic visualization for numbers and made a timerclass
		* Added BigDouble class to handle large numbers
12/8	* Fixed issues with numbers
		* Added settings page
13/8	* Made buildings Upgrades panel and implemented it

		* Have issue with adding multipliers for income and gain, need to store them in a list SO etc
		* SO stores data for levels between play turns, fix this?
		* Implement saving



		* Increment: Cost = BaseCost*multiplier^n
		* n = cost for building number n

		* Bulk buy =>  TotalCost = BaseCost * Multiplier^n*(multiplier^k-1)/(Multiplier -1)




		3. Typical Multipliers

		Slow growth (idle-heavy games): 1.05–1.10 (+5–10% per buy)

		Medium growth (balanced): 1.12–1.15

		Fast growth (prestige resets often): 1.2–1.5



		* Have numbers fixed in size so they dont move around when changing values.
		

		// Decide how to refill health - timer or potions?
		// Implement ORBs upgrades after deaths

		JAM 9/6 - 15/6 22:00

		* Add timer for enemy movement in relation to player movement ???

		// MUST HAVE

		* Main Menu 
		* Currency gold and orbs
