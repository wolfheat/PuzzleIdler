DEVLOG FOR Idle Game with a puzzle touch

Aug 2025

* IDEAS
- Make an idle game that has some puzzle or other game mechanics in it.

10/8	* Project started
		* Made basic visualization for numbers and made a timerclass
		* Added BigDouble class to handle large numbers
12/8	* Fixed issues with numbers
		* Added settings page
13/8	* Made buildings Upgrades panel and implemented it
17/8	* Implemented basic save system
18/8	* Solved serialization issue with BigDoubles
		* File saving implemented, Gems and Coins upgrades, Time
		* Fixed issue with saving dateTime, and rewarding player correctly
19/8	* Away Income now formats correctly for large numbers
		* Settings now saves and load Active notation correctly
23/8	* Application saves before closing
		* Added research tab and implemented automatic loading from researchData 
		* Research list Items now show correctly
24/8	* Percent shows
27/8	* Added sprite Assets for showing coins inside texts as emojis
		* Added option to show some text in another style sheet	font 
		* Resetting buildings or research aut saves to file correctly		
		* Gain is now calculated correctly for buildings items

		* Make sure rewards are rewarded for resources

		* Make sure description text for rewards show correctly with different text fonts
				
        // Maybe not have gems GPS added when away??


		// Issue, gains are added as their values when added, but multipliers the player buy afterwards does not act on these earlier gains. Need to recalculate the entire gain every time gain changes?

		* Show welcome box with away income when loading a game

		* EveryTime a save is made also update the DateTime


		* Have issue with adding multipliers for income and gain, need to store them in a list SO etc
		

		// SAVING
			* Building levels
				every time a building is built update the buildings levels in player game data
			* Upgrades purchased
				every time an upgrade is bought update the upgrades owned dictionary in player game data
			* Held coins, gems
				contantly update this to the player game data so it is up to date when a save is happening?
			* GPS coins, gems
				This is derived from the upgrades only so dont need to save?
				Only need the base income? Base income is also constant so no

		- AutoSave at regular interval?


		// Make sure adding buildings or upgrades does not break old save files



		* Increment: Cost = BaseCost*multiplier^n
		* n = cost for building number n

		* Bulk buy =>  TotalCost = BaseCost * Multiplier^n*(multiplier^k-1)/(Multiplier -1)




		3. Typical Multipliers

		Slow growth (idle-heavy games): 1.05–1.10 (+5–10% per buy)

		Medium growth (balanced): 1.12–1.15

		Fast growth (prestige resets often): 1.2–1.5



		* Have numbers fixed in size so they dont move around when changing values.
		

		// Decide how to refill health - timer or potions?
		// Implement ORBs upgrades after deaths

		JAM 9/6 - 15/6 22:00

		* Add timer for enemy movement in relation to player movement ???

		// MUST HAVE
		* Implement several stages
		* Game Name
		* Itch page
		* Main Menu 
		* Currency gold and orbs
		* Character Animations

		// LIKE TO HAVE
		* Bosses?
		* Random generated levels?
		* Biomes?
		* Implement shop between levels - every or every 5th etc??
		* Fix color Palette for Characters
		* Damage dealt effects
		* Random Generated dungeons
		* Maybe issue - can have no sword equipped but still attacks with melee
		* Allow rotations? Make smooth transitions	

		// PROB NOT
