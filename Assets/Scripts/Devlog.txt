		// CHESS
		* make players color show better

		// TETRIS - inputs
		/ I think people usually have their controls as the reverse of yours, using left hand for hard drop and spinning and right hand 
		/ for moving left/right. personally i use z/c for spinning, x for hard drop, arrow left/right arrow keys for moving, up for hold, 
		/ down for soft drop, and lshift for 180 spins.
		//
		/ Left hand: Z/X/C to rotate and Space bar to Hold, and ESC to pause
		/ 
		/ Right hand: arrow keys to move/soft drop/hard drop 

		* Clean upi updating save file from any games, make it better


		// ASSETS
		Gems and Crystals - Free	Aztech Games


		
		* Decide what to do with games multipliers when offline, 
			* keep them unaffecting the total and not counting down
			* count down and give the corresponding value

		* Added minesweeper base code, now make it work with this project


		// Chessmove that still needs a test
		* Opponent played en-passentable move, player can play en passent but it is not the win, or it is an alternative win

		I only know one CEO in person. And that is pushing the meaning of a "CEO", "being" and"in person" a lot...


		// Need to check if its check mate and also count that as a win


		// Clean Up Chess code


		// Fix en passent

		* Make sure a loaded level is stored so player faces it next login

		* Issue with promotions as solution
			* Make player unable to move pieces when picking a promotion
			* Implement Computer promotions

		* Issue with castles? - Prob just a regular move, but needs implementation in my code correctly
		* Issue with en passent as solutions?



		* Make sure invalid chess moves are ignored
			* Moving to unreachable tile
			* Placing on a piece of same color
		

		* Add reset button for Upgrades on cheatbar
		* Add complete tiers amount and multiplier?


		* RESEARCH
		* Move to first unbought when completing a tier

		
		* Make sure description text for rewards show correctly with different text fonts
				
        // Maybe not have gems GPS added when away??


		// Issue, gains are added as their values when added, but multipliers the player buy afterwards does not act on these earlier gains. Need to recalculate the entire gain every time gain changes?

		* Show welcome box with away income when loading a game

		* EveryTime a save is made also update the DateTime


		* Have issue with adding multipliers for income and gain, need to store them in a list SO etc
		

		// SAVING
			* Building levels
				every time a building is built update the buildings levels in player game data
			* Upgrades purchased
				every time an upgrade is bought update the upgrades owned dictionary in player game data
			* Held coins, gems
				contantly update this to the player game data so it is up to date when a save is happening?
			* GPS coins, gems
				This is derived from the upgrades only so dont need to save?
				Only need the base income? Base income is also constant so no

		- AutoSave at regular interval?


		// Make sure adding buildings or upgrades does not break old save files



		* Increment: Cost = BaseCost*multiplier^n
		* n = cost for building number n

		* Bulk buy =>  TotalCost = BaseCost * Multiplier^n*(multiplier^k-1)/(Multiplier -1)


		// Credits

		// Sudoku

		Medium growth (balanced): 1.12–1.15
